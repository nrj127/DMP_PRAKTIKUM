Install pbdlib on target:

Dependencies
PbDLib requires Armadillo for linear algebra operations, which runs faster if Lapack is also installed. PbDLib can be compiled with CMake.

sudo apt-get install cmake liblapack3 liblapack-dev libarmadillo4 libarmadillo-dev
Installation instructions
cd pbdlib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
