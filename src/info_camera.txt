sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-camera

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-freenect-launch

Do the following in you catkin_workspace/src 

git clone https://github.com/sniekum/ar_track_alvar.git

 fur

Change directory to ar_track_alvar

git checkout f093668

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ar-track-alvar

On one terminal do  roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch 

Now, change to launch file in the ar_track_alvar package, 

do roscd ar_track_alvar then cd launch and execute vim pr2_indiv.launch 

now change the middle three lines to 

	<arg name="cam_image_topic" default="/camera/depth_registered/points" />

        <arg name="cam_info_topic" default="/camera/rgb/camera_info" />

        <arg name="output_frame" default="/camera_depth_optical_frame" />

(I just changed kinect_head to camera since this is topic name published by the freenect launch file)

Also, do the following

rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure and click on the first icon.

now you need to use the marker, do the following

at a distance of 0.5 m place the marker in front of the camera, and execute the following command

rosecho /ARmarker_points

Now when you move the marker, you will see the position being displayed.

You need to use this position to do the next task, 

To visualize the results, 

open reviz, change the base frame to /camera_depth_optical_frame

then, add a marker topic, and a tf topic,

Now, you should be able to visualize the marker.
